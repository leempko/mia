# Medical Image Analysis

This is the website of the Medical Image Analysis course (NBE-E4010) taught by [Koen Van Leemput](https://users.aalto.fi/vanlek2) at Aalto University.

The teaching material used in the course consists of a tailor-made book and lecture slides:  
- book: [html](book/html/index.html) [pdf](book/mia.pdf)
- lectures:
  + Image smoothing and interpolation: [html](lecture_slides/smoothing_and_interpolation/html/index.html) [pdf](lecture_slides/smoothing_and_interpolation/smoothing_and_interpolation.pdf)
  + Coordinate systems, linear spatial transformations, landmark-based registration [html](lecture_slides/landmark_based_registration/html/index.html) [pdf](lecture_slides/landmark_based_registration/landmark_based_registration.pdf)
  + Intensity-based registration: [html](lecture_slides/intensity_based_registration/html/index.html) [pdf](lecture_slides/intensity_based_registration/intensity_based_registration.pdf)
  + Nonlinear registration: [html](lecture_slides/nonlinear_registration/html/index.html) [pdf](lecture_slides/nonlinear_registration/nonlinear_registration.pdf)
  + Model-based segmentation I: [html](lecture_slides/model_based_segmentation_I/html/index.html) [pdf](lecture_slides/model_based_segmentation_I/model_based_segmentation_I.pdf)
  + Model-based segmentation II: [html](lecture_slides/model_based_segmentation_II/html/index.html) [pdf](lecture_slides/model_based_segmentation_II/model_based_segmentation_II.pdf)
  + Neural Networks: [html](lecture_slides/neural_networks/html/index.html) [pdf](lecture_slides/neural_networks/neural_networks.pdf)

All material is available from a [git repo](https://github.com/leempko/mia/) under a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, and can therefore be used freely in other courses.

## Implementation

This website contains links to the teaching material and the schedule (see below). The [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/user/index.php?id=49017) website will be used only for organizational purposes, such as group creation and exercise assignments (material, report submissions and peer grading). 

Note that **this course is *not* designed to be an online course**: the primary venue to have your questions answered by the teacher and the TAs, and to get regular feedback on your work, is to physically attend the lectures and the exercise sessions. A dedicated Zulip course chat (link in MyCourses, login with Aalto account) will be used for important announcements, and for asking questions not yet answered during the lectures or exercise sessions.

The course is heavily focused on solving actual exercises in NumPy/Python (five in total, each split into an initial "easy" and a subsequent "difficult" part). These exercises will be performed in groups of 2 students. The course grading is based mainly on report scores given by the course personnel (teacher and teaching assistants), after an initial peer grading by fellow students for the "difficult" parts of the exercises. 

Participating in the peer grading is required to pass the course, and helping to answer fellow students' questions in the Zulip chat is encouraged (and will be viewed positively in the grading). Each student should also participate in student presentations where the submitted solutions to the "difficult" parts of the exercises are analyzed and discussed in class.


## Schedule

For the fall 2025 semester, lectures will be held on Thursdays 12.15â€“14.00 in Health Technology House, Auditorio - F239a. Exercise sessions with teaching assistants present will be held immediately following the lectures (14:15-16:00) in Nanotalo room 228.

> Note: no exercise sessions will be organized on Thu 20 Nov and Thu 27 Nov.
